Note: This script is work in progress. For now it only contains the logic(!) to check a system
for various software versions and their vulnerability against spectre/meltdown. It is lacking
lots of version information for various hardware platforms, microcode versions etc. simply because
the version list is huge and i only have access to a very limited number of distros and platforms.

Please supply your version information if its not already in here. Either setup a PR or contact me on
slack, jabber, mail or mention me on confluenc/jira.

A script to check a server for meltdown/spectre vulnerability.

Supported Distros
==================
- Debian Wheezy
- Debian Jessie
- Debian Stretch
- Debian Sid
- RHEL6/CentOS
- RHEL7/CentOS

Supported hardware platforms
============================
 - Dell PowerEdge R2xx, R4xx, R5xx, R6xx, R7xx, R8xx
 - HP ProLiant DL160 Gen9, DL380 Gen9

Other platforms can be added easily, see FAQ below.

Requirements:
=============
- Python2 (since it has to work on older distros that might not have 3)
- dmidecode utility
- intel-microcode (iucode-tool) if you run intel cpus
- amd64-microcode if you run amd cpus
- a directory containing the latest microcode updates from intel

What does it do?
================
The first step is to collect system version information for bios, kernel, microcode and xen (if installed).
The way the data is collected, varies depending on the distro. See all the _get_*() functions on how thats done.

Once the data is collected, it is checked against known good versions. Good versions are compiled in
variables at the top.

KERNEL_VERSIONS - by distro, custom versions supported in field 'Custom'
XEN_VERSIONS    - known to be safe xen versions, custom versions supported in field 'Custom'
BIOS_VERSIONS   - mapping from hardware platform to bios version, no custom versions supported
MC_VERSIONS     - mapping from cpu to microcode version, no custom versions supported

See all the _check_*() functions on how versions are checked.

What it does not do
===================
It does NOT change anything, it just collects data and analyzes it.

How do i use it?
================
Have a look at the help with 'gather.py -h' and adjust enter parameters is required. There are no
special parameters required.

The output can be customized to be parseable or readable.

Todo
====
- Fully implement microcode check support. As of now it can only tell if an update is available.
- Extend version information list for bios, microcode, kernels and xen versions.
- What do you need?


FAQ
===
Why is my distro not supported?
I mainly have access to Debian-systems and a limited number of CPUs. Thats the info i can supply. The rest
has to be gathered by you to help others.

How can i add supported for my hardware platform?
Update the BIOS_VERSIONS dictionary with your information. The name is the one returned by 'dmidecode -s system-product-name'.

How can i add supported for my processor and microcode version?
Update the MC_VERSIONS dictionary with your information. The processor name is taken from '/proc/cpuinfo'.

How can i add supported for my distro?
Update the KERNEL_VERSIONS dictionary with your distro and safe kernel-version information. The distro-name must match the name returned by _get_os_release().

How can i add safe xen-version?
Update XEN_VERSIONS with a known to be safe version string. _get_xen_version() uses the string from 'xl/xm info'.
